					<div class="title">Hi, my name is Corbin Cahalan.</div> 
					<div class="paragraph">Iâ€™m your typical Californian, but a not-so-typical person. Born and raised in Los Angeles, I am a 22-year-old who has lived his entire life in sunny California. From the beach to the trails, I love spending time outdoors and am always looking for an adventure.<br><br>

					In May 2018, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelors in Interdisciplinary Studies and an emphasis in consumer behavior and data analytics. Combining courses in Business, Economics, Computer Science, and Sociology, I created my own major and wrote a thesis on online targeted advertising and the ethical implications behind tracking consumer data.<br><br>

					My time in the Bay Area helped me discover my career interests in data analysis, business, tech, and entertainment. I invite you to take a look around my website and get to know more about my professional experiences and life beyond the workplace. If you'd like to get in contact with me or have a lunch together, please contact me!</div>

					<p>Sincerely,</p>
